Ldap_Login is a Piwigo plugin to allow people to connect and get access to a piwigo website with their LDAP credentials.

There is an option to allow creation of new users if they are granted access by LDAP but don't exist in Piwigo DB.

This plugin has originally been developed by 22decembre and adjusted to Piwigo 1.8 by kvakanet.

The current forks exist:
* https://github.com/22decembre/ldap_login		=> original plugin
* https://github.com/kvakanet/ldap_login		=> adjustments to Piwigo 2.8
* https://github.com/f1dot4/Ldap_Login			=> another LADAP-plugin targeted at ActiveDirectory servers
* https://github.com/RomanBuchert/Ldap_Login	=> fork from that with adjustments for OpenLDAP
* https://github.com/monsieur-a/piwigo_ynh		=> LDAP-plugin for Yunohost
